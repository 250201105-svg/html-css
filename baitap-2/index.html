      <h2>1. What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is not a programming
        language. It is a markup language used to structure content on the web.
        When you open a website, the browser reads the HTML file and displays
        the content in a readable format. The browser understands tags like
        headings, paragraphs, links, and images, and it places them on the page
        based on the structure you write.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of HTML like the skeleton of a human body. It gives shape and
        meaning to the content. Without structure, a webpage would be just a
        messy block of text. With HTML, you can clearly separate titles from
        paragraphs, highlight important words, and organize your ideas into
        sections.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Headings and Paragraphs</h2>
      <p>
        Headings help your reader understand what the page is about. Usually, a
        page has one main heading using h1. Then you can use h2 for section
        titles, and h3 for smaller topics inside a section. Good headings make
        your page easier to scan, easier to learn from, and more professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paragraphs are used for normal text. They are great for explanations,
        stories, examples, and instructions. When you write long content, it is
        better to split it into multiple paragraphs so it becomes easy to read.
        Even if your content is correct, people may not read it if it looks too
        crowded.

        3. Text Formatting: Bold, Italic, Superscript, Subscript
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes you want to change how text looks to make meaning clearer. You
        can use bold to highlight important words, and <i>italic</i> to add
        emphasis or show special terms. In modern HTML, <b>strong</b> is often
        used for text that is important, not just visually bold. Also,
        <i>em</i> is used to emphasize text in a meaningful way.
      </p>

      <p>
        You already used <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>. These
        are useful for math, science, and notes. For example, you can write H2O
        for water, or 10² for "ten squared". These small details make your
        content more accurate and easier to understand.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Practice Task</h2>
      <p>
        Your goal is to practice writing clean HTML. Start by adding a new
        section about yourself. Write a heading like “About Me” and then write
        two long paragraphs. In the first paragraph, explain why you want to
        learn web development. In the second paragraph, describe your learning
        plan for the next 30 days. Use bold to highlight key words like your
        goals, and use <i>italic</i> to emphasize one important sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, add another section called “My Daily Routine”. Write 5 to 8 lines
        of text in a paragraph, and use to put each routine item on a new line.
        For example: “07:00 - Review notes”, “07:30 - Practice typing”, “08:00 -
        Build small HTML page”. This helps you practice both paragraphs and line
        breaks.
